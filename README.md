# ctp_v6 — CTP (PCR) Production Scheduler

A finite-capacity production scheduler for **JK Tyre CTP Chennai (PCR)**.

It runs the **`v6_wave_p2` algorithm** — the scheduler already proven at BTP Banmore — against
CTP's data. The phase files are **byte-identical copies** of v6's, except for **three
deliberate, documented deviations** (see below). All CTP-specific data adaptation is isolated in
a single file, `adapt_inputs.py`, so the algorithm itself never has to know it is running on a
different plant.

---

## Quick start

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd ctp_v6

python -m venv .venv
# Windows:  .venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:  source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

python run_all.py
```

That's it. Python **3.10+**. Everything needed is bundled — **no database, no network, no
external paths.** Every path resolves relative to the script, so it runs from any directory.

**⚠️ Out of the box this stops at phase 2 with a `ValueError`. That is expected and correct —
see [Known blocker](#-known-blocker) below.**

### Running parts of it

```bash
python adapt_inputs.py            # rebuild inputs/ from ctp_inputfiles/ only
python run_pipeline.py            # run the phases (assumes inputs/ exists)
python run_pipeline.py --from phase4
python run_pipeline.py --only phase5
python run_pipeline.py --skip phase0

python make_data_issues_report.py # -> CTP_DATA_ISSUES_FOR_PLANT.xlsx
```

## How it works

```
ctp_inputfiles/          the plant's raw masters (BOM, routing, curing plan, WIP, …)
        │
        │   adapt_inputs.py     <-- THE ONLY PLACE CTP DIFFERS FROM v6
        ▼
inputs/                  the same data, in v6's exact schema   (generated, git-ignored)
        │
        │   run_pipeline.py     <-- runs v6's phases, in v6's order
        ▼
outputs/  outputs2/      lots, DAG, CPM windows, the schedule  (generated, git-ignored)
```

`inputs/`, `outputs/` and `outputs2/` are **derived** — they are rebuilt on every run and are
not committed. Only `ctp_inputfiles/` is source data.

### The phases

| # | phase | what it does |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `phase0_validate_inputs` | Validates the inputs. Report only — safe to `--skip`. |
| 1b | `phase1b_demand_explosion` | Curing plan → BOM explosion → per-item demand |
| 1.5 | `phase1_5_wave_builder` | 3-day waves, plus the load-balance pass |
| 1c | `phase1c_mrp_netting` | MRP netting — consumes opening WIP down the BOM |
| 2 | `phase2_lot_sizing` | Lot sizing, wave-aware bucketing, MPQ floor |
| 3 | `phase3_dag_construction` | Producer→consumer DAG + the aging edge filter |
| 4 | `phase4_cpm` | CPM time windows (EST / EFT / LST / LFT) |
| 5 | `phase5_forward_placement_v2` | Finite-capacity forward placement onto machines |
| 6 | `phase6_curing_revision` | Curing revision |

**`phase1a` (machine-group assignment) is not run** — CTP has no MG model. But it is not
*bypassed*: `adapt_inputs.py` synthesises its output, so v6's MG filter still runs **exactly as
written**. CTP's BOM is single-variant (`TBM PCR` on all 42,411 rows), which makes that filter a
no-op — correct by construction. The adapter **refuses to run** if a multi-variant BOM ever
appears, because then the filter would stop being a no-op and silently inflate demand.

## The three deviations from v6

Everything else is **byte-identical** to `v6_wave_p2/phases/`. Verify with `diff`, don't take
my word for it.

| # | what | why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Efficiency from the routing** | v6 hardcodes `eff = 1.0`. CTP's routing states **0.96**. `eff` divides, so every operation takes **+4.17%** longer. |
| 2 | **Transfer time from the routing** | v6 never reads `transfer_time_min`. It is a mandatory producer→consumer lag — the same shape as `min_aging` — so it is **added to `min_aging`**. Green tyres get a **90-minute** building→curing floor. |
| 3 | **The plant changeover matrix** | v6 has none: its `compute_changeover_min` is machine-**name**-based (`WBC`/`LTBC`/`FISCHER`…) and matches **0 of CTP's 123 machine IDs**, so everything would fall to a flat 15 min. |

Deviations 1 and 2 touch `phase2`, `phase4`, `phase5`. Deviation 3 touches `phase5`.

> **On deviation 3 — the join is the hard part.** The matrix is keyed on a machine **line name**
> (`"4 RC Calendar"`); the routing is keyed on a machine **ID** (`"901"`). **Zero string
> overlap**, and no bridge exists in any input file. The bridge is
> **`machine_to_changeover_line` in `config.yaml`**, built from the plant's own machine list
> (`ctp_inputfiles/pcr machines.png`). **Review that table.** `adapt_inputs.py` hard-fails if it
> names a line the matrix does not contain, so it cannot rot silently.
>
> Curing, GT-building and the mixers have **no line in the matrix** and correctly fall back to
> v6's rule — so **building still uses a flat 15 min changeover.**

## 🛑 Known blocker

**Phase 2 crashes on a clean run. This is deliberate. Do not "fix" it by coercing the NaN away.**

```
ValueError: cannot convert float NaN to integer     (phase2_lot_sizing.py:574)
```

Three items in `jkt_routing_pcr 14.xlsx` are **incomplete master records** — no `proc_time`, no
`proc_time_UOM`, **no machine**, and no `batch_size` for the compound:

| routed_product | ItemType | department | NET demand |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GT 2568 HT2` | Green Tyres | BUILDING | 19,036 |
| `GT 1482 UHL` | Green Tyres | BUILDING | 14,670 |
| `TCA313` | FINAL COMPOUND | FINAL MIXING | 239 |

An operation with no cycle time cannot be scheduled, and **no value has been invented.**

**Why the crash is load-bearing:** `phase4_cpm.py:368` does
`pd.to_numeric(..., errors="coerce").fillna(0)`. A NaN duration that survives phase 2 becomes a
**zero-hour lot** — the plan would happily build **33,706 green tyres in no time at all** and
report success. Deleting the routing rows is no better: `phase1b:225` would then drop those
items from demand entirely, trading a loud crash for the **silent omission of two green tyres
from the curing feed**.

**To unblock: fill those three rows in the routing master.** Then `python run_all.py` runs
2→6 straight through.

`python make_data_issues_report.py` writes **`CTP_DATA_ISSUES_FOR_PLANT.xlsx`** — every data gap,
with empty `PLEASE_FILL_*` columns, ready to hand to the plant team.

## ⚠️ The bug class that bites everyone: "present-but-blank"

**Read this before adding or refreshing any input.**

Every v6 parser reads numbers like this:

```python
try:    v = float(row["Col"])
except (TypeError, ValueError, KeyError):    v = None
```

That handles a **missing** column or row. But **`float(NaN)` returns `NaN` — it does not
raise.** So a cell that is *present but blank* yields `NaN`, never `None`. And `NaN` defeats
**every** downstream guard, because all NaN comparisons are False:

| guard | with `NaN` |
|---|---|
| `if x is not None and x <= 0:` | **False** → the NaN survives the sanitiser |
| `if x:` | **True** → NaN is truthy |
| `max(0.0, NaN - 8.0)` | **0.0** → the window silently collapses |
| `int(math.ceil(a / x))` | 💥 crash |

**v6's own masters contain zero blanks. That is its input contract.** CTP's masters are full of
them. So there are exactly two legal ways to say "no value":

1. **Omit the column** → `KeyError` fires → `None`. *(Used for CTP's no-max MPQ.)*
2. **Omit the row** → v6's `.get(key, default)` default fires. *(Used for 789 empty aging rows.)*

**A blank cell is neither, and is the one thing v6 cannot survive.**

Also: `adapt_inputs._read()` uses `keep_default_na=False`, so blanks arrive in the adapter as
empty **strings** (`""`), not `NaN` — `.isna()` alone silently matches nothing. Always test
`s.isna() | (s.astype(str).str.strip() == "")`.

Full hazard table, and every design decision with its reasoning, is in **`MEMORY.md`**.
